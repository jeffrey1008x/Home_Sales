# Home_Sales Data Analysis On Pyspark With Partition
18th Assignment for Data Bootcamp  

An exercise on applying the pyspark library to run sql queries with caching and partitioning.  
Home_Sales.ipynb runs on local environments.  
Home_Sales_colab.ipynb runs on Google Colab.  

I suggest grading with the colab version since I had an error partitioning locally.
